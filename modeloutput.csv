Each type has a corresponding category - practical example, natural language or friendly vibe. \nThe following conditions apply: \n1. CT includes the most detailed advice about strategic pickup lines. \n2. BT has fewer words than CT but more than FT. \n3. The practical example advice from BT is longer than the one in FT.\n4. The natural language advice from BT comes first in the sequence and FT comes last.\n5. The friendly vibe tip from FT is shorter than the one from BT.\n6. The longest piece of advice is not about a friendly vibe. \n\nQuestion: Can you find out which type of advice belongs to which category?\n\n\nBy rule 1, CT advice has the most detail and by rule 6, it's not advice on friendly vibes. By rule 2, BT advice can't be the longest because it has fewer words than CT. So BT must have the shortest piece of advice. This leaves FT with medium-length advice. \n\nBy rule 4, BT advice comes first in sequence and we know from step 1 that it's the shortest advice. By rule 5, FT advice is not the longest nor the shortest, so it must be the middle length. So, CT advice must be the longest advice left.\n\nAnswer: CT""}",phi-2.Q4_K_M.gguf,,,,,

Guess what happened to me today?? This is how friends talk on the phone (which you should know, if you have friends), so acting in this way will make her feel more comfortable with you. After your story, continue to chat with her for a little while and then abruptly say, ?well, it was cool talking with you. I?ve got to go meet my friends.? Do not invite her to anything. If you put in one phone call like this, you can be sure that she?ll answer the next time you call, and until then she?ll be wondering why you didn?t ask her out. Girls love anticipation, so give it to them! Other phone calls After the first phone call, it?s okay to ask her out after you?ve chatted for a few minutes. Just don?t be too eager. The best way to get her to go somewhere with you is to make spur of the mo - ment plans. If she commits to doing something NOW, there?s a low chance of flaking. If you plan for next week she has time to talk herself out of it or ? get\nOf course, there were also one hundred spectators who had come along. Every club we went to was lined with aspiring pickup artists who wanted to see what we could do. We stood on the patio of the Saddle Ranch in Hollywood. Three girls were standing near the railing with three of my pickup friends talking to them. Almost. One of them rudely had her back turned to my friend, who just couldn?t crack her. He laughed and came up to me. ? Try that one. I can?t get a word out of her.? I glanced around at the onlookers and started heading towards the girl. This would be impressive if I could pull it off. If not, it would be pretty embarass - ing. I addressed her, but she wouldn?t turn around. I told her a quick story and received no response. I?d never met a girl this cold before, but I couldn?t fail in front of all these people. I told her another story. And then another and another. Nothing. No response. Normally I would have given up, but there were too many people watching me.\nNow here?s the best part- after you checkout you?re left in a strange position. You have perishable foods, so you have to go home. If you don?t like her any - more, simply say, ?Hey? it was really great to hang out with you. I need to go home and put my food away, but maybe we?ll hang out some other time.? It?s a perfect excuse to leave. If you do like her, then you tell her that you have to bring your food home. Give her the choice of coming with you or meeting up with you afterwards. By then she will most likely feel comfortable coming home with you. If you?ve chosen a supermarket near you, then you can say ?Hey, I live a few blocks away, and I have to drop my food off before we go hang out. Want to tag along??
